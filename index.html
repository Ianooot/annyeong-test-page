        <h2>Who is Anya in Spy x Family?</h2>
        <p>
          Anya in Spy x Family enters the story as a prime candidate to be the
          pretend daughter of Loid. Despite being labeled as the quiet one by
          her caregiver, she impresses Loid by finishing a crossword puzzle in a
          matter of seconds.

          <br /><br />
          Loid immediately adopts the pink-haired child, thinking that she has
          the intellect to pass the entrance exam of Eden Academy, the same
          elite school that Donovan’s son Desmond attends. It is later revealed
          that Anya is actually a telepath named “Test Subject 007” who stole
          the answers from Loid as he looked at the puzzle and found out about
          his spy lifestyle.

          <br /><br />
          As Anya’s favorite anime is a spy series, she makes up her mind to
          become adopted by Loid, no matter what it takes.

          <br /><br />
          Things turn slightly awry when the two go on a shopping spree. Anya
          reveals her lack of education by misreading a bakery sign and
          miscalculating a purchase, making Loid think twice about adopting her.
          Reading his mind, Anya starts crying, prompting Loid to comfort her
          with a bag of peanuts (her favorite food).

          <br /><br />
          Now home alone, Anya refuses to study and looks around their apartment
          for any spy-related items, chancing upon a radio that accidentally
          reveals their location to Edgar, an Ostanian mob boss.

          <br /><br />
          Kidnapped by Edgar and taken to a secluded place, she is eventually
          saved by Loid in a realistic mask of Nguyen, a henchman of Edgar. As
          the disguised spy directs Anya to the police station, she
          telepathically learns about Loid’s past as an orphan.

          <br /><br />
          Moved by Loid’s experiences and empathy, Anya catches him on the
          street after the fight, and desperately asks if they can go home, to
          which he complies. With the two now on good terms, Anya in Spy x
          Family manages to pass the entrance exam of Eden Academy with the help
          of Loid’s study sessions.

        <h2>Personality of Anya in Spy x Family</h2>
        <p>
          As a child telepath, Anya in Spy x Family is very observant and finds
          ways to learn about and influence the people around her. Knowing more
          information than her own foster parents, she often directs the two
          with a childlike manner to reveal clues and solve problems.

          <br /><br />
          Growing up as a test subject-turned-orphan, Anya has a deep desire to
          be in a happy family. After several foster families returned her, she
          seems to have abandonment issues and latches onto Loid during their
          first days together.

          <br /><br />
          Besides the idiosyncrasies that come with being a telepath, Anya
          largely behaves like a child. Though her true age is unknown, Loid
          commented that she looks like a four- or five-year-old at best.I love
          learning new technologies, exploring nature, and reading science
          fiction.
